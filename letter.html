<p><b><i>(In your first paragraph include personal information)</i></b> I am very fortunate to have been provided with an excellent education that prepared me for the future. I currently have children in both elementary and middle school. Recently, I have become very concerned about legislative impact on education. As a parent yourself, I am sure that you share many of these concerns.</p>
<p><b><i>(Include facts)</i></b> Research has shown that schools with strong school library media programs have better rates of success. For example, in Alaska it was found that schools with a full time librarian scored higher on standardized tests than schools with only part time librarians. These schools were able to have longer hours of operation, leading to higher rates of circulation, thus impacting student achievement. Similar findings have been made in many other states across our country.</p>
<p><b><i>(State what you are asking for)</i></b> I ask that you support (Insert name of bill here). In supporting this bill funding will be provided that will support school library media programs. This is a very small price to invest in the future of our nations children. All children should have opportunity to achieve and develop skills necessary for the future. I believe that in supporting this bill you will impact the lives of countless children.</p>
Sincerely,
Jesca
